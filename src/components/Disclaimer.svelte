  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Use of AI (ChatGPT)</h3>
  <p class="mb-3">
    This tool uses a ChatGPT plugin to assist you in the process of Consequence Scanning. Throughout the tool you will have the option to generate suggestions and ideas for your project in order to help you identify consequences and plan risk mitigation.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    In order to utilise the AI plugin, we process your input data and pass it through the plugin. This means that any information input text fields (and other data input fields) will be processed by ChatGPT.
